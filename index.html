      <p>Welcome! My name is Danielle and I am a UX/UI Designer based in Los Angeles. With over a decade of customer experience under my belt, I strive to create the best user experiences possible.
        <br>
        <br>
        I came into the UX/UI world because I was looking for something that would allow me to utilize my creative skills but at the same time afford me the data analytics and problem solving that I crave. This field provides me the best of both worlds.

        <p>My favorite hobby is creating invitations, mainly wedding, for close friends and family. I love being able to help in some way on their special day.</p>

    <div id="two">
        <p>I learned Adobe PhotoShop in a minute crash course. The startup I worked for needed to get their pictures uploaded but they needed to be edited first. My position at that time was a customer service rep.</p>

        <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
        <p class="prob">
            <em><strong>Purpose: </strong></em>Paws4Healing strives to bring more awareness about the use and benefits of animal-assisted therapy to the greater Southern California community. As a design team, we saw an opportunity to create a more aesthetically pleasing design with an easier flow, focusing on the following key calls to action: community involvement, volunteering, and donations.  
        </p>
        <p><em><strong>Challenges: </strong></em>Very outdated, non-responsive design with no adaptive features makes the site hard to navigate. Key features such as donation and volunteer information is not easily found.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="solution">
        <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>To solve our problem, we did a complete rebrand, changing the logo, colors, navigation and bringing the key calls to action to the forefront.
